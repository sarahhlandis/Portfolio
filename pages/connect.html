        <h2>Hey there! <br> If you've found this page, hopefully you're wanting to know more about me as a person. If you're

        <p> So... a bit about me. I was actually born in India, and was adopted by an American family - my parents were both
            computer engineers but until recently, I actually had no idea what that entailed. I just knew they were <i>very</i> smart.
            My dad had an IBM Thinkpad in the 90s which was pretty high tech for the early days and I just remember vigorously pressing
            the little red mouse in the middle of the keyboard to see how fast it could travel across the screen.

            Fast-forward to now and I always seem to be the one in the group who's able to magically press a few buttons on most electronic
            devices and voilà - the item is working again! I've always liked computers and their advanced capabilities so it seems fitting
            that I've taken the route in synthesizing design and technology, in whatever way that may be.

            Since moving to Australia from Washington D.C. (USA), I've been lucky enough to gain a greater appreciation for the general 
            outdoors. I enjoy spending time in the sun and near the ocean. I try to live a mindful and purposeful daily life, with balance 
            and energy. I spend a lot of time doing pilates and riding horses (when I can)! My husband and I also love to travel and experiencing
            new places. A fun fact about me - I've gone cage-floor diving with great white sharks off the coast of South Australia!
